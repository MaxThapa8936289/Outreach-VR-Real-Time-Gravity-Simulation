# Outreach-VR-Real-Time-Gravity-Simulation

An N-Body Simulation for Unity to be experienced with the Oculus Rift. Created for the purposes of Physics Outreach with the University of Manchester. 
Based on Skrawk's GPU-GEMS-NBody-Simulation: https://github.com/Scrawk/GPU-GEMS-NBody-Simulation.

Two "fly-through-space" type programs are constructed to accept particle position and velocity data in .csv file format. This Project is "Real Time Gravity Simulation", 1 of 2.

Files must be perfectly formatted with each line containing data in the form: x,y,z,vx,vy,vz,m

Files must be placed in /StreamingAssets/

Real Time Gravity Simulation is an 49152-Body simulation with particles coloured by velocity. Some intial hard coded initial distributions are included.

See report for more information.
